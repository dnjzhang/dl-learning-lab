Hi John,

I was reviewing the API documentation for the new authentication service and noticed a few endpoints seem to be missing from the specs. Could you help clarify if this was intentional or if we should update the docs?

Specifically, I'm looking at:
- /auth/refresh
- /auth/validate

Thanks!
Alice""",

    Hi, Joe.  I know you are busy, but it is time to review plan for next quarter's projects.  We need to determine the priorities for the known projects.
    After we review the priority, we will need to prepare a PPT for the management for approval.
